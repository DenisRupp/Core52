<h3>Flexiblility</h3>
<p>You can have your cake and eat it too: enjoy convention <em>and</em> configuration with Core52!</p>
<h3>MVC</h3>
<p>Core52 uses the familiar Model-View-Controller architecture, with a twist&#8230;</p>
<h3>Lightweight</h3>
<p>Core52 is fast, really fast. We autoload all models and libraries, and lazy load wherever possible.</p>
<h3>PHP 5</h3>
<p>Core52 leverages the object-oriented greatness that is PHP 5.2*.</p>
<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>Core52 is pre-integrated with more than a dozen common third-party libraries, including API clients for Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>We took a cue from EllisLabs and made the documentation for Core52 second to none.</p>
<h3>Powerful Form Processing</h3>
<p>Hand-coding form validation routines gets old quick&#8211;really quick. Core52&#8242;s Form library handles validation, rendering, filtering, and sanitizing so you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<h3>Secure</h3>
<p>Core52 has been tested&#8211;and hardened&#8211;over more than a year of use, and has been designed to prevent many common security flaws, including XSS, SQL injection, and more.</p>
<h3>Error Reporting</h3>
<p>Backtraces and query logs are standard in Core52, making bug-squashing a breeze! In production, your application can automatically &#8220;phone home&#8221; every error report via email&#8211;along with GET, POST, and Session dumps.</p>
<h3>Raw CLI Power</h3>
<p>For those intense behind-the-scenes tasks, you can leverage the full power of Core52 inside commandline scripts with a single include. Multiprocessing? Shared Memory? Daemons? We&#8217;ve got you covered there too.</p>
<p>* PHP 5.3 is not yet supported.</p>
