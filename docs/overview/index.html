<p>Core52 is a lightweight, non-obtrusive MVC framework for PHP, designed for rapid application development. It was partly inspired by CodeIgniter and Rails and developed internally at Company52 over the course of 18 months.</p>
<h3>You will like Core52 if&#8230;</h3>

<li>You want to fully harness the power of PHP</li>

<li>You are annoyed by CodeIgniter&#8217;s PHP4 backwardness</li>
<li>Web services form a regular part of your diet</li>
